HOW TO RETURN vaneck.sequence length:
    PUT {[1]: 0} IN seq
    WHILE #seq < length:
        PUT #seq-1 IN i
        WHILE i>0 AND seq[i]<>seq[#seq]: PUT i-1 IN i
        SELECT:
            i=0: PUT 0 IN seq[#seq+1]
            ELSE: PUT #seq-i IN seq[#seq+1]
    RETURN seq

PUT vaneck.sequence 1000 IN eck
FOR i IN {1..10}: WRITE eck[i]>>4
WRITE /
FOR i IN {991..1000}: WRITE eck[i]>>4
WRITE /
