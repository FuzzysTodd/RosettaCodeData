The '''[[wp:Perlin noise|Perlin noise]]''' is a kind of [[wp:gradient noise|gradient noise]] invented by [[wp:Ken Perlin|Ken Perlin]] around the end of the twentieth century and still currently heavily used in [[wp:computer graphics|computer graphics]], most notably to procedurally generate textures or heightmaps. 

The Perlin noise is basically a [[random numbers|pseudo-random]] mapping of <big><big><math>\R^d</math></big></big> into <big><big><math>\R</math></big></big> with an integer <big><math>d</math></big> which can be arbitrarily large but which is usually 2, 3, or 4.

Either by using a dedicated library or by implementing the algorithm, show that the Perlin noise (as defined in 2002 in the Java implementation below) of the point in 3D-space with coordinates 3.14, 42, 7 is 0.13691995878400012.

''Note: this result assumes 64 bit IEEE-754 floating point calculations. If your language uses a different floating point representation, make a note of it and calculate the value accurate to 15 decimal places, or your languages accuracy threshold if it is less. Trailing zeros need not be displayed.''
