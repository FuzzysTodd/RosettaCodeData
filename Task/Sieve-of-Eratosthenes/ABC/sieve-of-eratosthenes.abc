HOW TO SIEVE UP TO n:
    SHARE sieve
    PUT {} IN sieve
    FOR cand IN {2..n}: PUT 1 IN sieve[cand]
    FOR cand IN {2..floor root n}:
        IF sieve[cand] = 1:
            PUT cand*cand IN comp
            WHILE comp <= n:
                PUT 0 IN sieve[comp]
                PUT comp+cand IN comp

HOW TO REPORT prime n:
    SHARE sieve
    IF n<2: FAIL
    REPORT sieve[n] = 1

SIEVE UP TO 100
FOR n IN {1..100}:
    IF prime n: WRITE n
