HOW TO REPORT prime n:
    REPORT n>=2 AND NO d IN {2..floor root n} HAS n mod d = 0

HOW TO RETURN digit.sum n:
    SELECT:
        n<10: RETURN n
        ELSE: RETURN (n mod 10) + digit.sum floor (n/10)

HOW TO REPORT additive.prime n:
    REPORT prime n AND prime digit.sum n

PUT 0 IN n
FOR i IN {1..499}:
    IF additive.prime i:
        WRITE i>>4
        PUT n+1 IN n
        IF n mod 10 = 0: WRITE /

WRITE /
WRITE "There are `n` additive primes less than 500."/
