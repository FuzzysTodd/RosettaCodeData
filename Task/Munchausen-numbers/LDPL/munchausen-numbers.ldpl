procedure:
for i from 1 to 5001 step 1 do
    store 0 in sum
    store i in n
    while n is greater than 0 do
        modulo n by 10 in d
        raise d to d in d
        add sum and d in sum
        divide n by 10 in n
        floor n
    repeat
    if sum is equal to i then
        display i lf
    end if
