Insitux (pronounced /ɪnˈsɪtjuːɪks/) is a dynamically-typed functional scripting language inspired by Clojure, originally commissioned in July 2021 for safe and extensible in-game scripting in a popular Roblox game. It has retained compatibility with Roblox by using two sets of "poly-fills" between [https://roblox-ts.com/ roblox-ts] and Node.js / web, meaning it can target Roblox, Node.js, and web with two slightly varying codebases.

Despite its origins it is a capable language, with development focusing on the language itself, its Node.js ecosystem, and to a lesser extent its web ecosystem. This primarily involves adding to the already 200+ built-in operations, which tend to cause existing Insitux programs to shrink in size over time.

Insitux currently does not have a performance focus, and due to its syntactic flexibility, and its engine being transpiled into both JavaScript and [https://luau-lang.org/ Luau], it is difficult to optimise. Eventually Roblox support will be dropped / forked, pivoting mainline Insitux into AOT and JIT JavaScript transpilation.
