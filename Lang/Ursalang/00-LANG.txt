Ursalang, or Ursa for short, is a "friendly, stable, general-purpose programming language" according to its [https://ursalang.github.io/ web site]. At present, it is quite new, and not yet stable, but according to its [https://github.com/ursalang/ursa#readme README], "The intention is that once it reaches version 1, the language will not change or evolve further."

Ursa is functional (the syntax consists only of expressions), and imperative (using constructs familiar from mainstream languages) with a familiar syntax similar to JavaScript.
