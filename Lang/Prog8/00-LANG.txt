'''Prog8''' is a modern compiled programming language targeting computers based on the MOS 6502 family of CPUs. The compiler and standard library have support for the Atari 8-bit family (6502), Commodore 64 (6510) and 128 (8502), and the Commander X-16 (65c02). It's a relatively low-level language in the same niche as C, but specifically designed for the 8-bit architecture of its target systems.
