'''YAMLScript''' is a new programming language that uses [https://yaml.org/ YAML] as its syntax. It is a complete, functional, general purpose language, but can also be easily embedded in YAML files to make them dynamic at load time. Most existing YAML files and all JSON files are already valid YAMLScript programs. YAMLScript has a compiler/interpreter CLI program called <code>ys</code> and is also available in several programming languages as a binding module to the <code>libyamlscript.so</code> shared library:

* [https://metacpan.org/pod/YAMLScript Perl]
* [https://pypi.org/project/yamlscript/ Python]
* [https://raku.land/zef:ingy/YAMLScript Raku]
* [https://rubygems.org/gems/yamlscript Ruby]
* [https://crates.io/crates/yamlscript Rust]

==Installing YAMLScript==

Run this command to install the <code>ys</code> command line YAMLScript runner/loader/compiler program.

  curl -s https://yamlscript.org/install | PREFIX=$HOME BIN=1 bash

That will install <code>$HOME/bin/ys</code>. If <code>$HOME/bin</code> is not in your <code>PATH</code>, run:

  export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH

Test the new installation:
 $ ys --help
