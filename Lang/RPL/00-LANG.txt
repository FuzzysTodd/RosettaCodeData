'''RPL''' (an acronym for '''Reverse Polish Lisp''') is the onboard calculator language for the HP-28, [[wp:HP 48 series|HP 48]] and HP-49/50 lines of graphing calculators. It is a stack language (not a [[Lisp]]-like language, as its name implies), tightly integrated with the calculator system, with many instructions similar to Forth.

It can natively handle unsigned integers (named ''binary integers''), floating-point numbers (named ''real numbers''), complex numbers, vectors and matrices (named ''arrays''), lists, character strings, and algebraic expressions. The HP-49/50 models can also handle long integers (up to 500 digits) and benefit from several dedicated built-in functions to work with, including testing and generation of prime numbers.

There are actually two languages with the name RPL: '''User RPL''' and '''System RPL'''. System RPL is used in implementing the operating system, and User RPL is the language users use to write programs on the calculator. System RPL is highly hardware-dependent, whilst User RPL is upwardly compatible.

The language [[RPL/2]] is a recreation of this language for POSIX machines.
