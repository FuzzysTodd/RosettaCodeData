{{stub}}{{language|TI BASIC}}
TI BASIC is the language included in the TI-99/4 (1979) and TI-99/4A (1981) computers. It is similar to Dartmouth BASIC 6th edition. It does not have some features in Microsoft BASIC such as multi-statement lines, other statements after IF..THEN, PEEK, POKE, and USR. It's capabilites are between those of Minimal BASIC and GW-BASIC. It is slower than the BASIC in most other computers but it has high accuracy for calculations.

It can be used to read and write data files on disk but it is not ideal for reading text files (known as DISPLAY/VARIABLE 80 in the TI file system) because the INPUT #X statement would stop reading a line before the end if it contained a comma. This problem was solved with TI Extended BASIC by the addition of the LINPUT #X statement which is like LINE INPUT# in Microsoft Disk BASIC.

Many TI-99/4A owners had a TI Extended BASIC cartridge to write or use more advanced programs, including assembly language programs. Almost all TI BASIC programs would run correctly in TI Extended BASIC.
