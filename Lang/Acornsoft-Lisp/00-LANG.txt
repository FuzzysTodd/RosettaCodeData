'''Acornsoft Lisp''' is a dialect and implementation of [[derived from::Lisp]] developed in the early 1980s for the [[wp:BBC_Micro|BBC Micro]] and related machines.

In the original, 1980s version, all built-in defined names were in upper case; however, versions that use lower case instead have become available.

It is a very small Lisp.  The only data types are lists, symbols, 16-bit integers, and the types that represent built-in functions and special forms.  Even basic list-processing functions such as <code>length</code>, <code>append</code>, <code>reverse</code>, and <code>equal</code> are not built in.  It can nonetheless be used to write interesting programs.
